It features a 50MP primary sensor, a 12MP front camera, and supports 8K video recording at 30fps. The camera app is also highly customizable, allowing you to adjust settings to your liking. In comparison, the Redmi Note 10 has a 48MP primary sensor and 13MP front camera, but it struggles in low-light conditions. While it can still capture decent photos and videos, the quality is not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S21. If you prioritize camera performance, especially in low-light conditions, I would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S21.",
