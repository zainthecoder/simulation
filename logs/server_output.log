             'Redmi Note 10 has an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars based '
             'on 50,000+ reviews. The Samsung Galaxy S21 is known for its '
             'exceptional camera performance, powerful processor, and sleek '
             'design, whereas the Redmi Note 10 excels in its affordability '

             "AGENT: The Samsung Galaxy S21's camera performance is "

             'recording at 30fps. The camera app is also highly customizable, '
             'allowing you to adjust settings to your liking. In comparison, '
             'the Redmi Note 10 has a 48MP primary sensor and 13MP front '
             'camera, but it struggles in low-light conditions. While it can '
             'still capture decent photos and videos, the quality is not as '
             'good as the Samsung Galaxy S21. If you prioritize camera '
